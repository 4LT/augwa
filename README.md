# NOT READY FOR PRIME-TIME

Snagging this sweet crate name before some name-squatter does

0.0.2:
* LITERALLY just rename README.MD to README.md so crates.io knows what's up

0.0.3:
* Correct version of previous changes in changelog
* Add tests for reading beyond limit + appropriate fixes for failing tests
